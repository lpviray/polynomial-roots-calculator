# polynomial-roots-calculator
This is a C algorithm that evaluates polynomials efficiently by combining the stability of the Bisection Method with the fast convergence speed of the Newton-Horner Method. This application utilizes the command-line interface (CLI) for user input, and will also output the results of the calculator in the console.<br/>

The application can be used here at: [https://www.onlinegdb.com/bWNCxcWsa](https://www.onlinegdb.com/bWNCxcWsa)

Users will input the coefficients of the polynomial first in descending order of power, and then will conclude their input with two more numbers that will represent the interval over which the application will search for a root. Some sample arguments and expected results can be found in the Test_Cases.jpeg file located in the repository.<br/>

# Additional Features
 • The application is based in the terminal<br/>
 • Returns an error if no root is found within the interval<br/>

# Technologies Used
 • C<br/>
 • CLI<br/>
 • GitHub<br/>
